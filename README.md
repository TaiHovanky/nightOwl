nightlife project for freeCodeCamp

Users can search for bars/nightclubs in a city. This application uses the Yelp API to display search results to the user. All of the routing is done on the back-end - templates are served up when the user accesses specific routes.

In progress: 
User authentication. The goal is to enable users to log in and specify that they will be going to a certain bar. Users that aren't logged in should still be able to search for bars in a city.
